## Core Beliefs & Values
- **Driving meaningful progress fast is important** - Serves as a forcing function to concentrate on what is most critical
- **Action and progress creates energy and momentum** to keep moving forward
- **Doing difficult things, often** - Most effective way to achieve fast and holistic growth
- **Truth seeking always** - Being matter-of-fact drives clarity and focus
- **Being genuine** - Bad information compounds; most people appreciate candor. Trust and relationships are built on vulnerability
- **Less is more** - Clarity, elegance, and beauty in simplicity
- **Conducive environments** - Tacit knowledge is learned through osmosis by being around the best people; mimetic behavior is real and insidious
- **Kindness and gentleness**

## "Hard to Fake" Things (Personal Philosophy)

- Related projects: https://ai.google.dev/gemma/gemmaverse/sealion

### PhD Research: Embodied AI
- **Institution:** Nanyang Technological University
- **Specialization:** Embodied AI
- **Focus Areas:** Multilingual capabilities, code generation, agent-based workflows

### Research Focus: Maximum Compute (2025)
Exploring how Large Language Models perform optimally when provided with maximum compute, context, and thoughtful prompt design. Primary goals:
- Make tasks better, faster, and cheaper
- Code generation optimization
- Agent-based workflow implementation
- Increase utility of language models by achieving superior outcomes with fewer resources
- Minimize friction in high-value activities

### Research Questions (2024)
- **Interpretability:** How do the multilingual capabilities of LLMs work? Working hypothesis: models reason in English and subsequently translate their outputs
- **Data Attribution:** What specific types of data are most effective in addressing particular failure modes in LLMs?
- **Data Augmentation:** What creative methods exist for data augmentation beyond traditional English-based sources and techniques?

## Key Research Interest: Precise Instruction Following

Brandon has identified "Precise Instruction Following" as a critical evaluation dimension for AI models. Key observations:
- First noticed two years ago that only Claude-3-Sonnet could reliably follow the "answer in 1000 words" instruction
- Praised AI2's launch of "Precise IF Generalization Ability" evaluation (IFBench)
- Believes evaluating prompts with constraints (e.g., "reply only with 2 word sentences") that are programmatically verifiable is crucial
- Predicts similar evaluation frameworks will emerge for code generation
- Interested in exploring use cases where precise instruction following capabilities are required

## Insights on Future of AI Applications

### "Slow Thinking" vs "Fast Thinking" AI
Brandon believes applications using o3 models (slow thinking) will look fundamentally different from current "fast thinking" applications.

**Infrastructure "Nice-to-Haves" Becoming Core Requirements:**
1. Semantic caching for keeping $/request reasonable
2. Prompt engineering tools for creating page-long, high-level, step-by-step prompts
3. "Memory" for context awareness and personalization

**New Standards for User Experience Design:**
1. "In-the-background" AI systems not visible by users
2. AIs prompting humans for clarification
3. Task-level webhooks

## Technical Challenges & Observations

### Jupyter Notebooks
Brandon investigated the technical difficulty for auto-regressive models to parse and generate diffs for Jupyter Notebooks:
- The data structure representing a Jupyter Notebook is tedious even for humans to parse
- Generating diffs in notebooks requires non-trivial precision due to complex data structure
- This highlights limitations of auto-regressive models

## Personal Productivity System

### Weekly Accountability Framework
Brandon uses a structured system for improving daily accountability by asking himself weekly what progress he made on 3 key long-term goals:

1. **Career**
   - Example: Experimented with Anthropic API for Agent workflows, learned more about tokenizers

2. **Health**
   - Example: Completed 3x cardio workouts, meditated every day for 10 mins

3. **Relationships**
   - Example: Experimented with methods from "Fierce Relationships"

### Communication Tips
- **Feedback Technique:** Replace "but" with "and" when giving feedback
  - Example: "This is delicious, and I think it could be better with less sugar"
  - Example: "This looks good, and I feel this could be better by expressing the same algorithm with less code"
